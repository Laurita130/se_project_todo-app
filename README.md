# Simple Todo App

Todo Checklist is a simple and efficient project designed to help you keep track of your daily tasks. It allows users to easily add and delete items, as well as include specific dates to stay organized and on schedule. The project focuses on productivity and simplicity, making task management quick and convenient.

## Functionality

Add new tasks to their list, giving each item a clear description of what needs to be done.
Assign due dates to each task, helping users stay on top of deadlines and prioritize their work.
Mark tasks as complete once theyâ€™re finished, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment.
Delete tasks that are no longer needed, keeping the checklist clean and up to date.

## Technology
DOM Manipulation: Dynamically creating, updating, and removing task elements in real time.
Event Listeners: Handling user actions such as adding tasks, deleting them, and checking them off as completed.
Conditional Styling: When a task is marked as complete, a visual change (such as a checkmark icon, strike-through text, or color update) is triggered to indicate completion.
